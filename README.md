# Labela: AI Image Captioning Platform

Labela helps you generate high-quality captions for your images using AI models. It supports both experimenting with individual images and processing entire folders of images in batch.

## üåü Key Features

- Generate captions for single images to test and refine your approach
- Process entire folders of images in batch
- Review and edit generated captions
- Customize prompt templates to guide the AI's output
- Create example pairs to demonstrate your desired captioning style
- Supported AI providers: OpenAI

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and enter the directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TobiFank/labela.git
cd labela
```

2. Create and configure your environment file:
```bash
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
```

3. Build and start the application:

First time setup:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Subsequent runs:
```bash
docker compose up
```

4. Access the application:
- Web interface: http://localhost:3000

## üìÅ Working with Images

### Image Organization
- Place your images in folders within the `/data` directory
- The `/data/examples` directory is reserved for example pairs, which are automatically stored there
- Captions are saved as `.txt` files alongside each image in their original folder

### Using the Application

#### Test View
<img src="images/test_view.png" width="800" alt="Test View">

- Create and manage prompt templates
- Add example image-caption pairs to guide the AI
- Test caption generation with individual images

#### Batch Processing
<img src="images/batch_processing_view.png" width="800" alt="Test View">

- Select a folder from your `/data` directory
- Monitor processing progress and costs
- Review generated captions in the gallery view
- Use Quick Review mode to efficiently edit captions

#### Quick Review Mode
<img src="images/review_mode.png" width="800" alt="Test View">

- Enter Review Mode from the Batch Processing view
- Navigate through processed images with keyboard shortcuts
- View the full image alongside its caption
- Edit captions directly in the interface
- Changes are automatically saved to the caption files
- Exit review mode to return to the gallery view
